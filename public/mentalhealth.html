    <h2 id="what">What is Mental Health Awareness?</h2>
    <h3>
      The purpose of study in today’s world is to develop and enhance a
      well-rounded personality capable of handling the tasks of life with
      educational, emotional, physical and emotional maturity. In this regard,
      students of senior grade; i.e, grade 10 and 12, campaigned an awareness
      programme on Mental Health for Junior Graders. The rationale of this
      programme was to underline the causes which lay adverse effect on an
      individual’s mental health and what could be done to over-come such
      factors particularly at early years of one’s life. The response was
      applauding and Junior Graders appreciated the efforts.
    </h3>
    <h2>Rationale</h2>
    <h3>
      The Campaign is planned in line with <b>JIS Guiding Statement and CORE Values</b>
      and as a participation in <b>World Mental Health Day</b>. <b>Core Values</b> at JIS are
      summarized by the following quote: <b>AT ALHUSSAN WE EXCEL</b>. It represents the
      following core values to be prompted by the whole school community:
      <b><ul>
        <li>
          E: Empathy: The ability to understand and share feelings with others.
        </li>
        <li>
          X: Exemplary: Serving as a desirable model.
        </li>
        <li>
          C: Compassion: Concern for the suffering or misfortune of others.
        </li>
        <li>
          E: Efficiency: Competency in performance.
        </li>
        <li>
          L: Leadership: Act towards achieving common goal.
        </li>
      </ul></h3></b>
    </h3>
    <h2 id="why">Why is mental health important?</h2>
    <h3>
      Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act. It also helps
      determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make healthy choices. Mental health is important at every stage of life, from
      childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
    </h3>
    <h2>What is a mental health campaign?</h2>
    <h3>
      The campaign aims to raise awareness of mental health issues and mobilize efforts in support of mental health.
      The World Health Organization recognizes World Mental Health Day on 10 October every year. The theme of 2022&#39;s World Mental
      Health Day, set by the World Federation for Mental Health, is <b>&#39;Make mental health and wellbeing for all a global priority&#39;</b>. Hence,
      we will adopt the same theme.
    </h3>
    <h2>Why are mental health campaigns important?</h2>
    <h3>
      Mental health awareness campaigns <b>help to socialize mental health in an organization</b>. They help to increase peoples&#39;
      awareness and understanding of mental health, challenge stigma and foster a culture of openness within the workplace.

    <h3>
      <details>
        <summary>What is mental health?</summary>
        <p>
          We all have mental health which is made up of our beliefs, thoughts,
          feelings and behaviours.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What do I do if the support doesn’t help?</summary>
        <p>
          It can be difficult to find the things that will help you, as
          different things help different people. It’s important to be open to a
          range of approaches and to be committed to finding the right help and
          to continue to be hopeful, even when some things don’t work out.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Can you prevent mental health problems?</summary>
        <p>
          We can all suffer from mental health challenges, but developing our
          wellbeing, resilience, and seeking help early can help prevent
          challenges becoming serious.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Are there cures for mental health problems?</summary>
        <p>
          It is often more realistic and helpful to find out what helps with the
          issues you face. Talking, counselling, medication, friendships,
          exercise, good sleep and nutrition, and meaningful occupation can all
          help.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What causes mental health problems?</summary>
        <p>
          Challenges or problems with your mental health can arise from
          psychological, biological, and social, issues, as well as life events.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>What do I do if I’m worried about my mental health?</summary>
        <p>
          The most important thing is to talk to someone you trust. This might
          be a friend, colleague, family member, or GP. In addition to talking
          to someone, it may be useful to find out more information about what
          you are experiencing. These things may help to get some perspective on
          what you are experiencing, and be the start of getting help.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How do I know if I’m unwell?</summary>
        <p>
          If your beliefs , thoughts , feelings or behaviours have a significant
          impact on your ability to function in what might be considered a
          normal or ordinary way, it would be important to seek help.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>
          What should I do if I’m worried about a friend or relative?
        </summary>
        <p>
          This may depend on your relationship with them. Gently encouraging
          someone to seek appropriate support would be helpful to start with.
        </p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How do I deal with someone telling me what to do?</summary>
        <p>
          Some people may advise you on good evidence of what works with the
          best of intentions, but it’s important to find out what works best for
          you.
