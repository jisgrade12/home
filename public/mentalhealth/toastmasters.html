      District Director DTM Rami Jawad, Club Counsellor & Keynote Speaker DTM
      Peri, Honourable Guests, Dear Parents, Parents Council, Faculty, Club
      organizers and my dear gaveliers, good evening On behalf of the Alhussan
      Education, school management, faculty, and students of Jubail
      International School, I welcome you all to the Opening Ceremony of
      AlHussan Elite Gavel Club. We are indeed honoured and overwhelmed with
      your presence. It is a historical day in the educational journey of
      AlHussan Education- Jubail International School, as we are gathered here
      today to resume the Leadership Journey of our young leaders after a
      two-years pause due to the Pandemic. Our today’s young generation is often
      more comfortable communicating electronically than speaking face to face.
      Yet many events in their lives require interpersonal communication skills
      to be resolved successfully. Now, more than ever, they need guidance in
      developing their communication skills. With the help of “Elite
      Toastmasters Club” since 2015 we have taken this initiative in nurturing
      our young generation to develop their communication, public speaking, and
      Leadership Skills, which in turn has been fostering their self-confidence
      and personal growth. I, especially congratulate the students who have been
      accepted as members and mentors of this great Leadership Program. I am
      thankful to the staff who have taken the role of group leaders,
      organisers, and volunteers. I also congratulate the parents who got this
      unique opportunity for their children’s growth as communicators and
      leaders. I advise both the parents and students to take full advantage of
      this facility. I am also thankful to all Distinguished Toastmasters who
      will be mentoring our students and staff and providing their valuable time
      voluntarily. In line with our Guiding Statements and under
      school-community partnership program, besides academic excellence, we
      strive to develop our students’ growth through social and emotional
      wellbeing. Our Mental Health Awareness Campaign is part of this program
      and since last week various activities have been conducted by all
      departments. For this week and in addition to the activities conducted by
      all Departments, we will be having seminars by a psychiatrist Dr. Nesrine
      Smari from Mouawasat Hospital, our School Counsellor and today’s keynote
      speech by DTM Peri. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take the
      opportunity to share with you some of our achievements. JIS is now the
      Cambridge Direct Centre for IGCSE and A-Level Exams, we are also
      Examination Centre for College Board American Program, JIS is the
      Cambridge Professional Development Centre for PDQ Certificate and Diploma
      Program. We are an accredited school by CIS and COGNIA. We are GESS
      Competition Finalists 2022. We assure you that in accordance with our
      Guiding statements, we will keep our standards high and continue providing
      quality services. I am highly obliged to a renowned keynote speaker and
      corporate leader and our club counsellor DTM Peri for accepting our
      request to present a keynote speech today on Mental Health Awareness. I am
      sure we all will benefit from his words of wisdom. Thank you DTM Peri.
      Once again congratulations to all gaveliers and their parents. Thanks to
      the Toastmasters fraternity for their unconditional support.
