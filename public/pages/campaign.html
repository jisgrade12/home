            of new and un-met people. We don't call them strangers, we just call

            This is between me an <b>YOU</b>. We all know the hassle that comes
            with the break experience provided in the school. Of course it has
            to be boring but who said it can't be made into another wonder of
            the world. Well, while we won't be making it so, what we would be
            doing is enhancing your ticket to a better dine. To serve, we will
            have from hot and deep chocolate, to soft and chewy cookies.

            The journey doesn't end itself onto the surface of the canteen, but
            extends to an even better value of life: events. Not any events
            though; events that would make your adrenaline rush and your stomach
            cry. We are planning on brining the joyous moments by brining on
            Pizza Days, Ice-cream days, Bake sales, Movie Days, and Better
            trips.
